# Introduction

My name is Andrew, I am a third-year student attending **UCSD** and majoring in **Computer Science**. Though I am *not* a great programmer, I am always **eager to learn and striving to do better.**

Some basic VIM commands are:
```

vim [filename] - opens file in vim editor
i              - allows user to write/insert into file
esc            - switches out of insert mode
:wq            - saves changes to file and exits out of vim
```
